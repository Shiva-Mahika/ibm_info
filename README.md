      <h1>IBM</h1>
      <p><strong>International Business Machines Corporation</strong> (using the trademark <strong>IBM</strong>), nicknamed <strong>Big Blue</strong>, is an American multinational <a href="#">technology company</a> headquartered in Armonk, New York, and present in over 175 countries. It is a <a href="#">publicly traded company</a> and one of the 30 companies in the <a href="#">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a>. IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 19 research facilities across a dozen countries; for 29 consecutive years, from 1993 to 2021, it held the record for most annual U.S. <a href="#">patents</a> granted to a business.</p>

      <p>IBM was founded in 1911 as the <a href="#">Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company</a> (CTR), a <a href="#">holding company</a> of manufacturers of record-keeping and measuring systems. It was renamed "International Business Machines" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer of <a href="#">punch-card tabulating systems</a>. During the 1960s and 1970s, <a href="#">the IBM mainframe</a>, exemplified by the <a href="#">System/360</a> and its successors, was the world's dominant <a href="#">computing platform</a>, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide. Embracing both business and scientific computing, System/360 was the first family of computers designed to cover a complete range of applications from small to large.</p>

      <p>IBM debuted in the <a href="#">microcomputer</a> market in 1981 with the <a href="#">IBM Personal Computer</a>, — its DOS software provided by <a href="#">Microsoft</a>, which became the basis for the majority of <a href="#">personal computers</a> to the present day. The company later also found success in the <a href="#">laptop</a> space with the <a href="#">ThinkPad</a>. Since the 1990s, IBM has concentrated on <a href="#">computer services</a> and <a href="#">scientific research</a>; it sold its microcomputer division to <a href="#">Lenovo</a> in 2005. IBM continues to develop mainframes, and its supercomputers have consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world. In 2018, IBM along with 91 additional <a href="#">Fortune 500</a> companies had "paid an effective federal tax rate of 0% or less" as a result of Donald Trump's <a href="#">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>.</p>

      <p>As one of the world's oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for several <a href="#">technological innovations</a>, including the <a href="#">Automated Teller Machine</a> (ATM), <a href="#">Dynamic Random-Access Memory</a> (DRAM), the <a href="#">floppy disk</a>, the <a href="#">hard disk drive</a>, the <a href="#">magnetic stripe card</a>, and more.</p>
